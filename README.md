**The Notepad tool for any workspace or program**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description
Noteplus is a simple note taking desktop application that allows for easy sorting of notes as well as application specific notes.
Notes are seperated into 'Note Sets' which can be opened through the program itself. Note sets can also be assigned to an application given its path, if NotePlus is running in the background opening the specified application will open the designated note set.

# Explaination of Software
Noteplus provides a customizably application-specific solution to your note-taking problem.
Written entirely in C, Noteplus is a fast and lightweight note pad that you can set to open
alongside any program you wish, so when that program opens your notes are just as ready.

Notes are stored in note sets, with each set being tied to the respective assigned program.
Whether you are noting your thought process for a video you need to edit or recording details for a puzzle
you need to solve in a game, your notes will be there for you automatically.
