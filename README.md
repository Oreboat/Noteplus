# Noteplus
**The Notepad tool for any workspace or program**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description
Noteplus is a simple note taking desktop application that allows for easy sorting of notes as well as application specific notes.
Notes are seperated into 'Note Sets' which can be opened through the program itself. Note sets can also be assigned to an application given its path, if NotePlus is running in the background opening the specified application will open the designated note set.

# Explaination of Software
Noteplus provides a customizably application-specific solution to your note-taking problem.
Written entirely in C, Noteplus is a fast and lightweight note pad that you can set to open
alongside any program you wish, so when that program opens your notes are just as ready.

Notes are stored in note sets, with each set being tied to the respective assigned program.
Whether you are noting your thought process for a video you need to edit or recording details for a puzzle
you need to solve in a game, your notes will be there for you automatically.

# How to Use
Keybinds:
  CTRL+S -> saves your working file, prompting you to make a note if you haven't already
  CTRL+N -> creates a new note, automatically saving your previous file
  CTRL+O -> opens an existing note
  CTRL+SHIFT+S -> Save a note to noteset
  CTRL+SHIFT+O -> Open a noteset
  CTRL+SHIFT+N -> Create a new noteset
  CTRL+SHIFT+M -> Create a new noteset w/ tagged app


After launching Noteplus, you can use CTRL+SHIFT+M to create a noteset alongside a partner program.
When this partner program is launched, Noteplus will launch, opened to the noteset correlated with the partner program.
You are also allowed to open other notesets and other notes freely using the respective keybinds.

Notesets do not need to be tied to a partner program. Using CTRL+SHIFT+N, you can create a new set independent
of a program and write notes there.

When editing a note, you can save it at any time. If a note is not established before saving,
saving will prompt you to name the note.

When creating a new note, saving will automatically occur before the new note is opened.

To exit the program, simply x it out. Be careful to save first!
